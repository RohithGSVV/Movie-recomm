# Movie Comparison and Recommendation System

## Objective
Create a web-based system for movie comparison and personalized recommendations using a single dataset.

## Technologies
- Docker
- PostgreSQL
- Python
- Flask/Django (for backend)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend)

## Project Design

### Phase 1: Project Setup

#### Environment Setup
- Install Docker if not already installed.
- Create a new directory for your project and set up a version control system like Git.

#### Docker Setup
- Write a `Dockerfile` for your Python environment.
- Write a `docker-compose.yml` that defines two services: one for your web application and one for the PostgreSQL database.

### Phase 2: Backend Development

#### Database Schema
- Analyze the dataset to design your database schema.
- Create SQL scripts to define tables and relationships.

#### Data Import
- Write a Python script to import your CSV data into the PostgreSQL database.
- Ensure data integrity and normalize data where appropriate.

#### Web Application Framework
- Set up a Python web framework (Flask or Django).
- Implement routes/endpoints for movie data retrieval.

### Phase 3: Machine Learning Model for Recommendations

#### Recommendation Engine
- Decide on a recommendation system approach (content-based, collaborative filtering, or hybrid).
- Develop a recommendation algorithm using Python and libraries such as scikit-learn.

### Phase 4: Frontend Development

#### Frontend Web Development
- Design the UI/UX for your web application.
- Develop the frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Implement AJAX calls to interact with the backend.

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement

#### Testing
- Write unit tests for the backend.
- Perform integration testing to ensure the frontend and backend work together seamlessly.
- Conduct user acceptance testing with potential users and gather feedback.

### Phase 6: Deployment

#### Deployment
- Choose a cloud provider for deployment (AWS, Heroku, DigitalOcean).
- Configure Docker for deployment.
- Deploy the application and monitor its performance.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Docker**: For containerization of the application and database.
- **PostgreSQL**: For data storage and management.
- **Python**: For backend logic and machine learning model.
- **Flask/Django**: As the web framework for the backend.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For frontend development.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing the recommendation system.
- **Cloud Service Provider**: For hosting the application.

## Post-Launch

- Collect user feedback and make necessary updates.
- Maintain the application with regular updates and backups.
